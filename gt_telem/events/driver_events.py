        on_shift_light_high (List[Callable]): List of async callbacks to be executed when the engine RPM crosses above the maximum alert RPM.
                                            Callbacks receive the current engine RPM as a parameter.

    Methods:
        __init__(self, tc: TurismoClient):
            Initializes the DriverEvents instance and registers the _state_tracker callback with the provided TurismoClient.

        _state_tracker(t, context):
            Static async callback function to track driver-related events based on telemetry data.

    Usage:
        # Example usage:
        tc = TurismoClient()
        driver = DriverEvents(tc)

        # All callbacks are async and receive the relevant value as a parameter
        driver.on_gear_change.append(lambda gear: print(f"Gear changed to: {gear}"))
        driver.on_flash_lights.append(lambda state: print(f"High beams: {state}"))
        driver.on_brake.append(lambda brake_value: print(f"Brake applied: {brake_value}"))
        driver.on_shift_light_low.append(lambda rpm: print(f"Low shift light at RPM: {rpm}"))

        Static async callback function to track driver-related events based on telemetry data.

        This method compares the current telemetry data with the previous state to detect
